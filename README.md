## Overview
TACOS receives an arbitrary point-to-point network topology and autonomously synthesizes the topology-aware All-Reduce (Reduce-Scatter and All-Gather) collective communication algorithm. TACOS is powered by the Time-expanded Network (TEN) representation and Utilization Maximizing Link-Chunk Matching algorithm, thereby resulting in greater scalability to large networks.

Below figure summarizes the TACOS framework:

## Getting Started
1. Download the TACOS project.
```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:astra-sim/tacos.git
```

2. Run TACOS with the provided script.
```sh
./tacos.sh
```

If you'd like to analyze the codebase, `runner/main.cpp` is the main entry point.

### Docker Execution Environment
To assist the execution environment setup, you may also consider building a Docker image.
```sh
docker built -t tacos .
```

You can start the Docker container as a sandboxed execution environment.
```sh
docker run -it -v /path/to/your/tacos/repository:/app/tacos tacos

# once Docker container starts running
cd /app/tacos
./tacos.sh
```
