## Overview
TACOS is a topology-aware collective algorithm synthesizer:
- TACOS receives a network topology description and target collective patterns.
- Then, TACOS autonomously analyzes provided inputs and synthesizes topology-aware collective algorithms.

The below figure summarizes the TACOS framework:

### Restrictions
TACOS currently supports:
- Network topology: point-to-point (direct-connect) only. Networks can be asymmetric and heterogeneous.
  - Switch should be unwound to point-to-point connections.
- Target collective pattern: All-Gather
  - Although Reduce-Scatter and All-Reduce can be supported by TACOS, their implementations are currently in progress.
  - All-to-All is not supported in TACOS.
- Output: TACOS currently reports the estimated collective time of the synthesized collective algorithm.
  - MSCCL-XML generation is currently in progress so that the TACOS algorithm can run on real systems via MSCCL (see [MSCCLang Paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3575693.3575724)).

### Paper
Please find more information about the framework in the TACOS paper [[IEEExplorer]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05301) [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05301).
